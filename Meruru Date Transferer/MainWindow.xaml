As such, please treat this as a hacking tool. I also offer no warranty about using program, even if the creators of Atelier Meruru decide to change the saved game file format. Please enjoy responsibly and try not to blow up the universe too much. No warranties against harm or damage&#xA;&#xA;Try to save the game, do whatever in the game takes up a lot of time, then save now to 2 different slots. Slot #2 is your backup in case this tool really screws over the save, but I didn't find that necessary. &#xA;&#xA;I could try making the day setting more precise, but the saved game is encrypted with what looks like a bit shifting pattern. This tool basically transfer the date information from the input file to the output file instead. This program may transfer flags over, so you might only want to rewind a few weeks ago when there are no events happening outside any income that comes from certain investments. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You do something that spends a lot of time like synthesizing, and when nothing happens when you walk out and back into the Atelier, it's a good point to rewind to. I did this, and I beat the game using this tool. There's also plenty of safe points to rewind. I also kept it within the same year&#xD;&#xA;&#xA;If Steam Cloud Save messes up your save, try modifying the save while the game is running, then immediately load the game after you modify it. It doesn't matter if the date reads correctly. Findings from this tool are on the Github page." VerticalAlignment="Top" Width="731" Grid.ColumnSpan="2"/>
